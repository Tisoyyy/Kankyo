KANKYO: Environment Reporting Application

KANKYO (Japanese for Environment) is our research team's project proposal for DENR Region 10 in the Philippines. The purpose of this app is 
to let the public directly report any Environment issues/damage to DENR.

Currently, this app is still in development and further changes are still to be made by the team.
